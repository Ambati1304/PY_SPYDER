Page Rank algorithm is a popular algorithm used by Google
PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites

This code is an implementation of this popular algorithm in python sourced from Dr.chuck's course 'Pyhton for everybody' and has slight modifications.
